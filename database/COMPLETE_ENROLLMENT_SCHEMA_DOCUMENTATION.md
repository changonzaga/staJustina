## üîó Database Relationships

### Primary Relationships
```
students (main student table)
    ‚Üì (1:many)
enrollments (core enrollment record)
    ‚Üì (1:1) enrollment_personal_info [Step 1]
    ‚Üì (1:2) student_addresses [Step 2: current + permanent]
    ‚Üì (1:3) student_family_info [Step 2: father + mother + guardian]
    ‚Üì (1:1) enrollment_academic_history_new [Step 3: academic]
    ‚Üì (1:many) student_disabilities [Step 3: multiple disabilities]
    ‚Üì (1:1) shs_student_details [Step 3: SHS students only]
    ‚Üì (1:many) enrollment_documents [Step 4: documents]

- CASCADE DELETE: When enrollment is deleted, all related data is removed
- CASCADE UPDATE: When enrollment ID changes, all references are updated
- UNIQUE constraints prevent duplicate relationships (e.g., one current address per enrollment)
